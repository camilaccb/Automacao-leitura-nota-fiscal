# Automacao-leitura-nota-fiscal

This is a project to automate invoice reading. 

### Context

There is a government program ("Sua Nota tem Valor") created to make everyone aware of the importance of demanding invoices or receipts, as well as to encourage participation in social control and the application of public resources. More information about program [here.](https://suanotatemvalor.sefaz.ce.gov.br/oprograma/)

To join the program and you have to input your invoices into an app. The way you can do it is using a scan feature availabe in app. 

### Problem

Quite often the scan feature is not able to recognize the number of invoice and I have to input it manually what takes more time and effort. This situation discourages my participation in the program.

### Proposal

Create a solution using python to automate invoice reading making possible a simple copy paste of invoice number into app.
